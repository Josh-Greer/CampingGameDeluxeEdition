Description of idea:
I figured it would be better to cut down on my code for the PA just to make things like
the algorithm simpler for me, but wound up cutting out things I wanted to keep in. This gave
me the opportunity to flesh out "A Camping Game where you aren't Attacked by Wolves" while also
practicing stuff like functions and lists. Since I haven't done python in a while I figured
brushing up on these things would be useful so this was a good opportunity to do so.

Reflections:
Overall, I relearned how to use functions, lists, and some list methods. In terms of further
questions maybe just what applications these things could have for the next PA. It seems
to be decently interesting, but i'm not sure if these will be useful yet. In the end this homework
was so much more enjoyable and better for practicing than the Zybooks work has been even though
it probably took longer.
